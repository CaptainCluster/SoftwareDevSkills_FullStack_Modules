This repository contains all the code regarding the *MEAN-stack* modules of the **LUT University** course
*Software Development Skills: Full-Stack*. When it comes to learning, I got to experience how to use the tools
that form the *MEAN-stack* when combined together. Out of all of these tools, I have used everything, except
*Angular*, in the past.
